//KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm is a substring search algorithm. LPS: Longest proper Prefix which is also Suffix. For example, "abcdeabc" has the LPS "abc" . Note that the string itself can't be an LPS of itself

let T='aabacc';
let n=T.length;
let P='abac';
let m=p.length;

logic:

1. s=P$T // total size = n+m+1
2.calculate- LPS[] of size
3.iterate and find if(LPS[i]==m) in LPS[] and return the present or not .
